# Random Password Generator

## Description

This app was designed to provide random passwords based on specific input criteria. The passwords vary in length from 8 - 128 characters and can include both upper- and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This program solves the problem of having to come up with unique but not easily guessible passwords - especially helpful for protection valuable information such as banking accounts, company property, etc. I learned how to generate arrays of various sizes and concatenate them appropriately based on scaling information, provide boolean choices to allow those contents to be available, and how to generate a final product that is the accumulation of all allowed criteria sorted randomly.

## Usage

This app is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, only requiring clicking OK or Cancel on prompt dialog boxes. At least one criterion must be chosen and there is a failsafe in the code for this. Other than that, the process simply runs itself based on User input and supplies a password of appropriate length using only the criteria specified by the User.

## Credits

For this project, I collaborated with [Mark Lindsey](https://github.com/mrl-jr) and [Sam Martin](https://github.com/Marty20). They specifically helped with some formatting and with the final "for" loop to generate the password. I also used the sites [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) to assist with specifics regarding the .push method to help generate my final password array.
